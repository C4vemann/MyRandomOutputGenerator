# MyRandomOutputGenerator
<p><b>Algorithm:</b> Writes random characters to a file with a:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20% chance of a new line character</li>
  <li>30% chance of a space character</li>
  <li>50% chance of a random character between A-Z</li>
</ul>

<p>To <b>compile</b> this program:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open in a CLI (command line interface) and move to the location of where the file is stored.</li>
  <li>Type into the CLI: <i>javac MyRandom.java</i></li>
</ol>

<p>To <b>run</b> this program:</p>
<ol>
  <li>After compiling the program type into the CLI <i>java MyRandom "NUMBER"</i></li>
  <ul>
     <li>Where "NUMBER" is the amount of characters you want in the file</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
    
<p><b>Output:</b> A file called <i>output.txt</i> that consists of N random characters between the A-Z, spaces, and new lines, where N is a user-defined number</p>
