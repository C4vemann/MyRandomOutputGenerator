# MyRandomOutputGenerator
Algorithm:
  This algorithm, writes random characters to a file with a:
    - 20% chance of a new line character
    - 30% chance of a space character
    - 50% chance of a random character between A-Z

To compile this program:
  1. Open in a CLI (command line interface) and move to the location of where the file is stored.
  2. Type into the CLI "javac MyRandom.java"

To run this program:
  3. After compiling the program type into the CLI "java MyRandom <NUMBER>"
    - Where <NUMBER> is the amount of characters you want in the file
  
Output:
   A file that consists of N random characters between the A-Z, spaces, and new lines, where N is a user-defined number
